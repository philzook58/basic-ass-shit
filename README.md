# basic-ass-shit

Some basic, very minimal, meat and potatos haskell scripts to show you can do normal stuff in haskell too.

Get the stack Haskell build tool: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

To run
`stack build`
`stack exec X`

where X is one of the following

- basic-plot
- least-square
- serve
- jsonrequest


The interesting files from stack's perspective are package.yaml. This is where the libraries used for the above tasks are listed.
The source files are in src. Ain't much there.
